# Laravel Octane Docker Image Example

> This is a WIP (working in progress)

This is a repository with a fresh Laravel application using Laravel Octane.
The goal here is to provide a lightweight Docker image from Alpine linux,
with Swoole and all other extensions already setup and ready for production.

For local environments, Laravel Sail is recommended due to its easiness.
